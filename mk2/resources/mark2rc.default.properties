### console filters

# patterns are regexes. these must match the entire string in order to count as matching, as if they were
# wrapped in ^...$
pattern.foo=.*bar.*
pattern.lost-connection=.*lost connection

# patterns 'join', 'quit', 'chat', and anything else in the server config under mark2.regex.* are
# automatically initialized to the server's version, so they don't need to be redefined here.

# filters are of the form:
#  hide:foo,show:bar,hide:fubar
# if an action like 'hide' is not specified before the first pattern name, 'show' is assumed.
# an empty filter shows everything - otherwise the default action is the opposite of the first action in
# the list.
# patterns are applied in order, so
#  hide:1,show:2,3,hide:4   will hide everything matching 1, then show everything matching 2 or 3, then
#                           hide everything matching 4.
# some examples might help:
#  filter.example=                      show everything
#  filter.example=chat                  show only chat
#  filter.example=hide:chat             show everything except chat
#  filter.example=show:chat,hide:spam   show only chat, but not if it also matches 'spam'
filter.none=
filter.quiet=hide:lost-connection
filter.chat=chat,join,quit

# this is very temporary, pending a UI change that adds a way to choose at runtime.
use-filter=none
